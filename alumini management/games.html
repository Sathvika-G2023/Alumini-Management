<p> Friendly sports tournaments are always a good idea for alumni events. You can host all kinds of fun games and tournaments for your alumni for a simple but enjoyable event. This could include a sports day outdoors or a fun games evening inside.

<b>A rounders game: </b>
Much quicker than a game of cricket and much easier than a game of baseball. This is an excellent way to get everyone involved and build some team spirit.<br> <br>

<b> Darts tournament: </b>
Not so keen on outdoor sport? A darts tournament is a fun way to bring your alumni events indoors. You can enjoy a casual arts tournament over some drinks and snacks, and minimal resources are required for the event to be a success.<br> <br>


<b> Tennis contest: </b>
If youâ€™ve got a tennis court available and your alumni are feeling active, this can be a great way to encourage some friendly competition. You can also pair the alumni up to promote teamwork.<br> <br>

<b> Touch football day: </b>
 This takes the hard contact out of football and makes it a fun game for everyone to enjoy. Again, minimal resources are required.
